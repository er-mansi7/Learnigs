6 best tips for when you're stuck


Take a break - It might give you a new perspective

Articulate the problem precisely as if you're asking someone who doesn't know anything about it - This will make you dive deeper into understanding the challenge

Ask a colleague - If you will do it with a clear explanation as to what’s wrong, as described at the previous point, you will respect your colleague's time, and have better chances of getting the answer you need.

Isolate the technical difficulty - Take it to a clear environment and try solving it there

Ask a question on StackOverflow. Don’t just look for already given answers

Think outside of the box. Don’t confine yourself to the given assumptions
